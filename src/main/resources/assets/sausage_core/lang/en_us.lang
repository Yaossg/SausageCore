guide.sausage_core.entry.general.introduction.info.0=§lSausageCore§r is a mod developed by Yaossg, providing useful utilities and libraries for players and modders, on which any other mod developed by Yaossg dependents.\nVisit the mod's Github page below to learn more technical details.\nhttps://github.com/Yaossg/SausageCore
guide.sausage_core.entry.general.introduction.info.1=Why not try my sister mods §dManaCraft§r and §k§6Sausage's Factory§r? :)\nVisit my Github page below to learn more.\nhttps://github.com/Yaossg

guide.sausage_core.entry.general.ingredient.info.0=SausageCore adds 2 kinds of Ingredient, which are ItemWildcard and OreFilter.\nAbout this technical part, visit the mod's Github page to learn more.
guide.sausage_core.entry.general.ingredient.info.1=§lItemWildcard§r(sausage_core:item_wildcard) is literally minecraft:item, but with no tag of data, so it matches any metadata
guide.sausage_core.entry.general.ingredient.info.2=§lOreFilter§r(sausage_core:ore_filter) matches ore dictionary according to the predicate. Predicates you can use are:\n  - startsWith\n  - endsWith\n  - contains\n  - matches\n  - equals\n  - equalsIgnoreCase

guide.sausage_core.entry.general.world_type.info.0=SausageCore adds 2 world types, which are Buffet and CustomSize.\nIn the future a brand new type originally designed by Yaossg is coming. 
guide.sausage_core.entry.general.world_type.info.1=§lBuffet§r is minimal (1.13) buffet world, you can select a biome, which covers the entire world.\nIn the customize page, the middle button is used to switch among mods(e.g. If a biome in Mod A is being selected currently, clicking the button will cause the first one in Mod B to be selected).
guide.sausage_core.entry.general.world_type.info.2=§lCustomSize§r is a world type in which you can customize biome size(Default = 4, Large Biomes = 6).

guide.sausage_core.entry.general.debugging.info.0=/data is modelled after 1.13's but query only, which displays with grammar highlight. Additionally, it works on Players.\nHere is an example: (black characters below are white actually)\n\n§0{§bName§0: "§aZYL§0", §6Height§0: §61.68§cf§0}
guide.sausage_core.entry.general.debugging.info.1=§lDebug Stick§r is a very handy tool to switch block states, query blocks' states and NBTs and entities' NBTs.\nshift + use in the open air to switch among modes.
